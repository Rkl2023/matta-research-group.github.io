<h4 class="margin-top-2 margin-bottom-1 font-bold">Scholarships opportunities for prospective PhD students at King's</h4> 

Our group is looking to support applicants for a 4-year PhD project within the [King's MRC Doctoral Training Partnership in Biomedical Sciences](https://kcl-mrcdtp.com) on ["In silico engineering of degradable conjugated polymers for biomedical imaging and photodynamic therapy"](https://kcl-mrcdtp.com/project/in-silico-engineering-of-degradable-conjugated-polymers-for-biomedical-imaging-and-photodynamic-therapy/). The student will use a range of computational tools (quantum chemistry, machine learning, cheminformatics) to design novel degradable conjugated polymers for biomedical imaging/photodynamic therapy.
